Pubmed Parser: A Python Parser for PubMed Open-Access XML Subset and MEDLINE XML Dataset
========================================================================================


Pubmed Parser is a Python library for parsing the `PubMed Open-Access (OA) subset <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/ftp/>`_
and `MEDLINE XML <https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/licensee/>`_ repositories. 
It parses this information into a Python dictionary which can be easily used for research such in text mining and natural language processing pipelines. 
See our `Wiki page <https://github.com/titipata/pubmed_parser/wiki/>`_ or this documentation on how to download and process dataset using the repository.
